Scripts to create snapshots of IMDB data from the diffs.

Run ./batch.sh to create snapshots for all relevant lists.
To run in the background and log output to file, run:
./batch.sh > `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M.log` 2>&1 &

To convert IMDB lists into RDF format:
  Run rdf.py <timestamp>

If want to run batch.sh separately, then:
  Run synch.sh to download the data.
  Run patch.sh to create the snapshots for a list.
